# **Code Institute: Milestone Project 2**

## **Gwent Triathlon Club**

This project has been created for my Milestone Project 2 for the Full Stack Development Diploma at The Code Institute. The purpose of the project is to create an interactive front end using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Gwent Triathlon Club is a fictional triathlon club based in Gwent, Wales. The purpose of the website is to allow website users to learn more about the Gwent triathlon club, to derive answers about the club and attract new members to join the club. The user will interact with the website through a Google maps API to view their training locations; answering some questions to determine their club membership fee and by completing and submitting a joining form that it sent to a fictional club secretary.

## **UX**

### **Main Aims**
* To create a website that provides the information needed for the website users to learn about the Gwent triathlon club and that attracts new members.
* To create a website that provides a quick and simple way for new members to join the Gwent triathlon club.
* To make a website that uses Javascript to allow the website users to interact with the website.
* To design a website that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate for the wide range of potential users.
* To create a website that provides a good user experience on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

### **User Stories**
* I am a local triathlete, I want to know what membership price I would have to pay if I was to join the Gwent Triathlon Club.
* I am the club secretary at Gwent Triathlon Club, I want a simple way for new members to contact me so that I can invite them along to a free trial session.
* I am the manager a leisure centre in Gwent, I want to know where the local triathlon club currently train and find their contact details, so that I can invite them to rent my sports facilities like the swimming pool and running track.
* I am the chair of Gwent Triathlon Club, I want a website that looks professional, highlights what we do and the benefits of joining us, so that I attract new members to the club.
* I am a local person who wants to start duathlon, I want to know if I can join the club without be expected to join in swim training and if the club is suitable for beginners, so that I can decide if I want to join.
* I am a person who is new to sport and fitness, I want to know what triathlon is and what it involves, so that I can decide if I want to give it a go.

### **The 5 Planes of UX**
Having created the user stories so that I knew who I was designing my website for, I then followed the user centred design process to create a website that would answer the above user stories.
1. **Strategy Plane:**
    * When addressing the strategy plane, I focused on who the GTC website users were likely to be and the objectives the website needed to meet to attract these users. I kept in mind the question: Why is the GTC website so special?
        * Reason for the website’s existence – To serve the triathlon community of the county of Gwent in South Wales.
        * Culture of the audience – Triathlon community (including the single disciplines and multisport variations of swimming, cycling and running) and the wider fitness community.
        * User demographic – the club is open to all ages and abilities of triathletes including children, paratriathletes and senior members. The website branding therefore needs to appeal visually to all ages and genders. It must also be able to navigated easily as the users could have a wide range of computer competency levels.
   
    * I researched current triathlon websites (specifically [Malvern](https://www.malverntriathlon.co.uk/), [Evo](https://www.evotri.co.uk/) & [Manchester](https://manchestertriathlonclub.org.uk/)) to gather information on what these websites offer their users; the pros and cons that I liked as a user of their website and to identify the features and information they provided. This gave me ideas of how to address my user’s needs but also how I could further improve my User’s experience to add value to the GTC website.

2. **Scope Plane:**

    * When addressing the structure plane, I focused on the journey the website would take the users on. I kept in mind the question: What is an intuitive way to go navigate the content and features?
	    
        * How to get there? I knew that my website should include a navbar with tabs to enable users to easily navigate through the website content. There would also be buttons linked to specific parts of the website such as the ‘sign up’ form to allow users to quickly and easily access the main features.
	    * How will they move through the website? I decided to have 5 pages to the website: Home page (welcome and intro to the club), Training (with training locations featuring the map), Membership (featuring the membership packages and benefits of joining GTC), Triathlon (featuring a quiz to learn about/test knowledge of the sport) and Join (featuring the sign-up form, contact info and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)). By using this order, the user first learns about the club, can see the locations (to see if they are near to the user and if they meet the users needs), then learns about the membership benefits and pricing, then moves onto testing their knowledge/learning more about triathlon (e.g. to see if it is for them) and the once they have the above information  the user can make a fully informed decision about joining which takes them to the final page with the sign up form, FAQs to address any questions they may have and contact info in case they have further questions.

4. **Skeleton Plane:**

    * When addressing the skeleton plane, I focused on the keeping the layout design of the website familiar to the Users by using a standard layout the users would be use to seeing. I kept in mind the question: What conventions will the user be familiar with?
	
        * How to style the page? I knew that my website pages should be consistent in style and that they should use a standard page layout. I chose to use features the user would expect to see including: a navbar at the top of the page, a hero image, a callout message, a main body with titles and sub-titles and a footer at the bottom of the page.

5. **Surface Plane:**

    * When addressing the surface plane, I focused on the website branding and details like the colour, fonts and images. I kept in mind the question: What will be appeal to my users?
	
        * Hero images – relevant to triathlon
	    * Colour scheme – I chose to use the colours of green, white and red as these are the colours of the Welsh flag and Gwent Triathlon Club is a South and East Wales based tri club, so will appeal to the intended website audience. The colours are also gender neutral to have greater appeal. I choose the specific green (#00AD36), white (#FFFFFF) and red (#D30731) hex colours as these are the hex colours used on the Welsh flag.
	    * Map marker colours – I chose to have a different map marker colour for the swim, bike and run locations respectively to make it obvious to the user what training was at what location.
	    * Icons – I chose to use font awesome icons across the pages where it could aid the user’s understanding and for greater visual appeal.
	    * Logo – I chose to add font awesome swim, bike and run icons to improve the visual and make it easily understandable on first glance that the website is for triathletes as the logo is one of the first features the user will see upon accessing the website.


### **Technologies Used**
* HTML5 used for the .html pages
* CSS to style the html pages.
* [Bootstrapv5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) used for the grid layout to make the website responsive and to style appropriately for different screen sizes, to improve the user experience. I also used the bootstrap templates for the navbar (including the toggle button feature) and the buttons. I also used the Bootstrap template for the Javascript code to create the sticky navbar on desktop devices.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) used to style the headings and main text across all pages.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) used for the social media icons in the footer across all pages; for the swim, bike & run icons in the logo; on Training Locations page and on Membership page.
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview?hl=en_GB) to create the map of Gwent and map markers for highlighting the locations used by GTC for swim, bike & run training on the Training page.
* [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to integrate email into my project through emailing the submitted join up form to me and by returning an auto-reply email to the user on successful receipt on the form.

### **Credits**
* I got the code to initialise the Google map from the [Google API website](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/custom-markers?hl=en_GB).
* I used this [post](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-change-javascript-google-map-marker-color-8a72131d1207) to get the details of the different colour map marker urls.
* I used code from the [EmailJS documentation](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/sdk/send/) to add the necessary scripts, add my serviceID and templateID for my email functionality.
* I used [EmailJS email templates](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/templates) to create the template for both emailing the submitted form to my email and for the auto-reply email sent to the user upon successful submission.
