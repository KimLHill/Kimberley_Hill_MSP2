# **Code Institute: Milestone Project 2**

## **Gwent Triathlon Club**

This project has been created for my Milestone Project 2 for the Full Stack Development Diploma at The Code Institute. The purpose of the project is to create an interactive front end using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Gwent Triathlon Club is a fictional triathlon club based in Gwent, Wales. The purpose of the website is to allow website users to learn more about the Gwent triathlon club, to derive answers about the club and attract new members to join the club. The user will interact with the website through a Google maps API to view their training locations; answering some questions to determine their club membership fee and by completing and submitting a joining form that it sent to a fictional club secretary.

## **UX**

### **Main Aims**
* To create a website that provides the information needed for the website users to learn about the Gwent triathlon club and that attracts new members.
* To create a website that provides a quick and simple way for new members to join the Gwent triathlon club.
* To make a website that uses Javascript to allow the website users to interact with the website.

### **User Stories**
* I am a local triathlete, I want to know what membership price I would have to pay if I was to join the Gwent Triathlon Club.
* I am the club secretary at Gwent Triathlon Club, I want a simple way for new members to contact me so that I can invite them along to a free trial session.
* I am the manager a leisure centre in Gwent, I want to know where the local triathlon club currently train and find their contact details, so that I can invite them to rent my sports facilities like the swimming pool and running track.
* I am the chair of Gwent Triathlon Club, I want a website that looks professional, highlights what we do and the benefits of joining us, so that I attract new members to the club.
* I am a local person who wants to start duathlon, I want to know if I can join the club without be expected to join in swim training and if the club is suitable for beginners, so that I can decide if I want to join.


### **Technologies Used**
* HTML5 used for the .html pages
* CSS to style the html pages.
* [Bootstrapv5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) used for the grid layout to make the website responsive and to style appropriately for different screen sizes, to improve the user experience. I also used the bootstrap templates for the navbar (including the toggle button feature) and the buttons.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) used to style the headings and main text across all pages.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) used for the social media icons in the footer across all pages; for the swim, bike & run icons in the logo and on Training Locations page.
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview?hl=en_GB) to create the map of Gwent and map markers for highlighting the locations used by GTC for swim, bike & run training on the Training page.

### **Credits**
